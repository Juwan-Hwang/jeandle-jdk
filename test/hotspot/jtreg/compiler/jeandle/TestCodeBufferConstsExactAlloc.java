/**
 * @test
 * @summary Const sections are allocated exactly as planned.
 *
 *          Runs a const-heavy workload in a child VM with the CodeBuffer
 *          instrumentation enabled and checks the two invariants of the exact
 *          allocation path:
 *
 *            1. every method that reaches finalize() takes the plan-driven
 *               path, with no planner failure and no fallback to the legacy
 *               48 KiB reservation, and
 *            2. the consts capacity that CodeBuffer hands out never exceeds
 *               what is actually used by more than one alignment step.
 *
 *   Point 2: for a buffer that never expanded, the reserved capacity may exceed
 *            the planned size by at most one alignment step. A buffer that did
 *            expand is re-divided by CodeBuffer::expand(), so its residual is
 *            not bounded by the alignment and is checked only for safety
 *            (usage <= capacity, usage == planned).
 *          CodeBuffer::initialize_section_size() rounds the section start down
 *          to the section alignment, so the capacity is
 *          requested + ((limit - requested) % alignment). The extra bytes are
 *          a function of the blob address, not of the request, and cannot be
 *          removed by asking for a different size.
