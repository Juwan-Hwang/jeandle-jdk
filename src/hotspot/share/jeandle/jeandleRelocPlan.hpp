// Week 9: sizing the fourth CodeBuffer section, locs
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// HotSpot keeps the relocation information of each CodeBuffer section in its own array
// (`CodeSection::_locs_start` .. `_locs_limit`). Jeandle asked for one size for the whole
// buffer:
//
//     sizeof(relocInfo) + relocInfo::length_limit
//
// which is 2 + 15 = 17 bytes, i.e. 8 relocInfo slots after the integer division in
// CodeBuffer::initialize() - while the consts and stubs sections were handed
// `initialize_locs(1)`, which HotSpot floors to 4 slots.
//
// CodeSection::relocate() refuses to write a record unless
//
//     locs_end + relocInfo::length_limit < locs_limit
//
// so a section holding one record already had to grow, and every further record grew it
// again through CodeSection::expand_locs(): a REALLOC_RESOURCE_ARRAY plus a copy of
// everything written so far. That growth path is invisible to CodeBuffer::expand()
// accounting, which is how Weeks 5-8 could correctly report "Expand: total 0 (consts 0,
// insts 0, stubs 0)" while relocation arrays were reallocated thousands of times. The
// counters added this week (CodeBuffer's relocation census) measure it; the planner here
// removes it.
//
// Sizing locs is not `records * sizeof(relocInfo)`, for two reasons that both have their
// own function below:
//
//   1. A record is variable-length. relocInfo is one `unsigned short` holding
//      {type, format, offset}; a record with payload data is preceded by a prefix that
//      carries that data (folded into the prefix header itself when it is a single 10-bit
//      value). So a record costs between 1 and `relocInfo::length_limit` slots depending
//      on its type - and on the architecture, because RISC-V's jeandle_section_word
//      encoding stores 6 more halfwords than x86's.
//   2. Records store the distance from the *previous* relocated address, scaled by
//      `relocInfo::offset_unit`. Two records further apart than `relocInfo::offset_limit()`
//      bytes are bridged by filler records, one per step. A method with few records spread
//      over 4 KiB of code still pays for those fillers.
//
// Everything is an upper bound by construction: the per-type slot cost ignores the
// prefix-immediate folding (which only ever saves slots), and the filler term is derived
// from the section's own payload size, which bounds the sum of all record gaps.
